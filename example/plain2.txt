In a small, cobblestone village, there lived an old locksmith named Mr. Jenkins. One morning, he discovered that the master key he used to open every lock in his shop was missing. Panic filled his eyes as customers started arriving with broken keys and jammed locks.​
He searched everywhere—under the workbench, in drawers, even among the rusty nails and screws. Just when he was about to give up, a young boy named Timmy entered the shop, holding the lost key. “I found it near the flower bed outside,” Timmy said shyly. Mr. Jenkins rewarded the boy with a shiny new pocketknife and learned a valuable lesson: sometimes, the most precious things are found in the simplest places.
